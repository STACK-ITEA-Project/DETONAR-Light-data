# DETONAR datasets generated by Cooja

These datasets have been generated using Cooja, and contain the dataset of 100 simulations for each of the 8 attacks: Blackhole, Selective Forward, Sinkhole, Continuous Sinkhole, Local Repair, Version, DIS and HELLO Flood. Each dataset also contains 100 simulations where no attack is present, called the "Legit" scenario.

Each dataset correspond to simulations of networks with either 100%, 99.5%, 99% or 90% of success rates, for both transmission success rate and receiving success rate. 

For each success rate, there are two datasets acquired from logs of the same simulations, one for using the "sniffer approach" and one for using the "border router approach", in order to be able to compare the two approaches.
